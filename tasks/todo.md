# M25 — Record sets (implementation, branch `m25-record-sets`)

Spec: `tasks/25-m25-record-sets/`. One subagent per task; backend lane sequential (shared Gradle build and
service classes), UI lane parallel once the API exists. Each task is reviewed, tested and committed before the
next one in its lane starts.

## Backend lane
- [x] M25.1.1 — `RECORD_SET` asset type, containment, `RecordSetService`
- [ ] M25.1.2 — stored set query: validation, evaluation, rename rewrite, broken-query flags
- [ ] M25.2.1 — per-channel record templates on `DATASET`
- [ ] M25.3.1 — `RecordSetController`, record create by set, DTOs, `schema.d.ts`
- [ ] M25.2.2 — `recordset:` values, loops, reference editor, golden files
- [ ] M25.2.3 — incremental planning + build insight
- [ ] M25.4.1 — export/import

## UI lane (after M25.3.1)
- [ ] M25.5.1 — Content store record sets
- [ ] M25.5.2 — dataset record template editor
- [ ] M25.5.3 — reference picker, search, routing

## Finish
- [ ] M25.6.1 — docs + spec
- [ ] M25.6.2 — Playwright journey
- [ ] Full `./gradlew build` (`test --rerun`), `npm run build`, `npx vitest run` green; merge to master

# Project settings — merge tabs

Collapse the nine project-settings tabs to five:

- **General** = General + Channels + Languages + Media (in that order)
- **Generation** = Targets + Generation (in that order)

remaining tabs: General · Generation · Revisions · Navigation URLs · Import / Export.

## Approach

Composition, not code moves. Each existing tab component keeps its template, styles, state and API calls;
two thin container components (`ProjectSettingsGeneralViewComponent`, `ProjectSettingsGenerationViewComponent`)
stack them as sections and own the page scrolling. Only the section chrome changed — heading level and the
`height: 100%` / `overflow: auto` the children used to need as route roots.

## Steps

- [x] `project-settings-general-view.component.{ts,html,scss}` — General, Channels, Languages, Media
- [x] `project-settings-generation-view.component.{ts,html,scss}` — Targets, Generation
- [x] Children become plain blocks: drop `height: 100%` / `overflow: auto` from `:host` and from the
      top-level wrapper in `project-settings-{general,media,locales,targets}`, `channels`, `generation` SCSS
- [x] Demote section titles `h1` → `h2` in locales / targets / channels / generation (one heading level
      under the shell's sr-only `h1`)
- [x] `app.routes.ts`: `general` and `generation` point at the containers; `media`, `locales`, `channels`
      redirect to `general` and `targets` to `generation`, so old deep links (and the Playwright journeys)
      still land on the content
- [x] `project-settings-shell.component.html` + class doc: remove the Channels, Languages, Media, Targets tabs

## Review

- `npx ng build` green; only pre-existing warnings (NG8102 in globals/templates, SCSS budget).
- `npx vitest run`: 20 spec files fail with `resolveComponentResources` — verified identical on a clean
  `git stash`ed tree, i.e. the known broken `templateUrl` spec runner, not this change.
- No e2e tests written or run (as requested). The `settings/channels`, `settings/locales` and
  `settings/generation` journeys in `e2e/m16`, `m22`, `m24` keep working through the redirects.
- Visual check in the running app skipped at the user's request (login form needs a password).

# UI unit suite — fix the 85 failing vitest tests

Started at `20 failed | 28 passed` files / `85 failed | 240 passed` tests; ended at **48 / 327 green**.

## Root cause (one config bug, ~70 of the 85)

`ui/vitest.config.ts` had no Angular plugin, so `templateUrl` / `styleUrl` were never inlined and every
component with external resources died in JIT with
`Component 'X' is not resolved … Did you run and wait for 'resolveComponentResources()'?`.

- [x] `vitest.config.ts` → `vitest.config.mts` with `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular` (`jit: true`,
      `inlineStylesExtension: 'scss'`). `.mts` because the plugin is ESM-only and a CJS-transpiled
      `.ts` config cannot `require` it.
- [x] Pin `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular` to `1.13.1` — the floating `^1.9.0` had resolved to `1.22.5`,
      which imports `defaultClientConditions` from Vite 6 while vitest 2.1.9 brings Vite 5.
- [x] `src/test-setup.ts`: import `@angular/core/testing` at module scope instead of inside `beforeAll`.
      It registers the global TestBed-reset `beforeEach`/`afterEach` as a load side effect; from a hook
      that is too late, and every raw-TestBed spec failed with "test module has already been instantiated".
- [x] `src/test-setup.ts`: jsdom shim for `URL.createObjectURL` / `revokeObjectURL` (missing in jsdom, and
      `vi.spyOn` throws on an absent property).

## Per-spec fixes (stale specs the broken runner had been hiding)

- [x] `global-set-detail`, `project-settings-import` — `provideHttpClient()` + `provideHttpClientTesting()`
      for the `EditingLocaleStore → LocalesStore → ApiClient` chain M24 introduced
- [x] `project-settings-export` — stub the `globalsFolderTree` / `contentFolderTree` signals the component reads
- [x] `templates` — `provideRouter([])` (component now injects `ActivatedRoute`); flush `[]` rather than
      `{ content: [] }` for the bare-array `/channels` and `/datasets` endpoints
- [x] `navigation` — fixture wrapped in the fixed "All Navigation" root the tree endpoint always returns
- [x] `nav-reference-detail` — expect the trailing `locale` argument M24 added to `updateReference`
- [x] `pagination-editor` — a second `detectChanges()`: constructor effects read the control only after the
      creation pass. Stale "can't run in this workspace" note dropped from the spec and the component doc.
- [x] Query/change-detection hygiene across `sf-create-asset-dialog`, `sf-rename-asset-dialog`, `pages-list`,
      `revision-diff`, `project-settings-url-registry`, `project-settings-import`: `getByRole('button', …)`
      instead of `getByText` (which resolves to the inner `<button>`, so `.closest('button')` and
      multiple-match errors both bite), and `fireEvent` / `findBy*` where an assertion needs the pass after
      the event.

## One implementation change (agreed with the user)

`sf-create-asset-dialog.component.html` — the submit button was `[disabled]="form.invalid || submitting()"`,
which made the `markAllAsTouched()` guard inside `submit()` unreachable: clicking Create with a blank name
did nothing and explained nothing. Now `[disabled]="submitting()"`, matching `sf-rename-asset-dialog`.

## Review

- `npx vitest run` → **48 files / 327 tests, all passing**.
- `npx ng build` → green, only the pre-existing NG8102 and SCSS-budget warnings.
- No e2e run.
